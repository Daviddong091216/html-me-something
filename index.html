      <h1>My Point</h1>
      <p>Tools and energy are the two driving forces for human advancement. Programming is the greatest tool in human history. With the help of programming, the sum of wealth created by humans in the next 100 years will exceed the sum of all wealth in history.
Only with the help of programming, a company with a trillion-dollar market value such as Apple, Amazon, Mircosoft, and Facebook can be created in a very short period of time. A large part of the potential of programming is still being untouched. Whichever company can use this great tool well, can grow quickly and take a palce in the trillion-dollar club.
My value is staying foolish and staying hungry.</p>
